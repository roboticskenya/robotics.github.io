			<h3 id="header-3">The Rules</h3>
			<p>
				Getting the game rules for the year's challenge should be the first priority item for any team that is really interested in the robotics championships. In this article we are going to present the game rules for the Roboken 2017 Robitics Championships that was held at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi, Kenya.
			</p>
			
			<h3 id="header-3">Outline of the Contest</h3>
			<p>
				The game was derived from the activities that occur at the “poll stations” during the general elections process in the Republic of Kenya, where the voters are required to elect the candidates of their choice from the list of contesting candidates presented by the electoral body, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission(IEBC). IEBC is responsible for the issuance of voters’ registers, ballot papers and ballot boxes, verifying the voters against the list of registered voters, counting of votes and announcing the winners in all the polling stations. During the process, the voters are verified using their national identity cards and confirmed to be voters from the voters registers with the help of the Biometric voter registration system (BVR-system), after which the electoral officers issue the voters with the respective “ballot papers” for the contesting candidates for the positions of: Members of county assembly (MCA), Women representative, Member of parliament, Senator, Governor and the President; all these ballot papers are different in colours. The elector after being given the ballot papers is directed to a private area “a booth” to mark the candidate of choice, where he/she heads to the “ballot boxes”, distinguished with respect to the ballot papers as per the seat under contest to cast the vote, where after they leave the poll station to give chance for the next voter.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The game aims at the robots (the voter) reporting at the poll station (team A-blue field and team B-red field), getting his registration details verified by the IEBC officers, if registered, collects the ballot papers. In this case only three candidates; PRESIDENTIAL-RED ball, GOVERNOR-YELLOW ball & MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT-BLUE BALL). After collecting the ballot papers, the robot then goes to the voting booth to select his candidate. From this point the robot then heads to the voting boxes to cast their votes. The voting boxes are placed on a raised platform that is clearly visible for all to see.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The game robot is expected to report to the poll station, go to the verification desk, pick the ballot papers, select his/her candidate at the private boths and cast the votes in ballot boxes. The robot that achieves this in less than or three (3) minutes is declared the winner.
			</p>
			
			<h3 id="header-3">Game Procedure</h3>
			<p>
				<ol >

					</li>
					<li>
						At most two members of each team can engage in setting of robots.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any teams that fail to complete setting of the robots within one minute can resume the setting again once the game starts.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<h3 id="header-3">Deployment of the robots and team members at the start of the game</h3>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Game Robot must be started in the Start Zone.
					</li>
					<li>
						After starting the game robot, the team members who perform the starting action must leave the game field immediately.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<h3 id="header-3">Competition Tasks</h3>
			<p>
				Once the game has begun, each team shall complete the following tasks:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The Game Robot must go to the verification box
					</li>
					<li>
						The Game Robot will then collect the three ballot papers
					</li>
					<li>
						The Game robot then goes to the voting booth to select his or candidates
					</li>
					<li>
						The game robot then goes to cast the vote
					<li>
						Finally the game robot then goes to the start zone
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<h3 id="header-3">Deciding the Winner</h3>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The first team whose Game Robot successfully votes in the three candidates and goes to the starting zone within the 3 minutes shall be declared the winner.
					</li>
					<li>
						If neither team achieves the above within 3 minutes, then the winner shall be decided on marks scored and time taken. The score shall be decided as follows
						<ol type="i">
							<li>
								A team that is successfully identified and verified by going through the verification desk ( 9 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully picks a ballot paper (5 marks foreach ballot = 15 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully marks a candidate (passing through the booth) (5 marks for each ballot = 15 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully moves up the ramp with a ballot (5 marks for each ballot = 15 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully casts the three ballots correctly for each elective post(12 marks for each ballot = 36 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully leaves the casting zone down the ramp, after casting the three votes (5 marks)
							</li>
							<li>
								A team that successfully parks ( 5 marks)
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						Retries
						<ol type="i">

								Retries of a robot or several robots at the same time can be made as many times as necessary.
							</li>
							<li>
								A retry of game Robot is made at Start Zone only.
							</li>
							<li>
								During a retry, the team can request the referee to bring the ballot papers back to their previous positions. During a retry, the team can request the referee to bring the completed papers that was dropped on the way back to the starting point. The earned score still remains.
							</li>
							<li>
								During a retry, the team can bring all the objects which are held by the robots during asking for the retry back to the Start Zones. However the dimension of each robot and its objects in the Start Zone.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Game Robot is not allowed to place the ballot papers in the wrong box, this action causes violation and a retry is compulsory. The papers which are placed in the wrong boxes will be brought back to the starting point.
